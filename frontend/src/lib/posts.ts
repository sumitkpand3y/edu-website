        <p>The market for healthcare services in India increased by 10% in 2021, reaching $31.6 billion. The Indian healthcare providers market is anticipated to reach $129.8 billion in 2026, up 28.8% from 2021. The healthcare sector has never needed to innovate business models and create new revenue streams more than it does now, especially as it works to enhance lives and standard of living. The movement toward new business models is already under way.</p>
        
        <p>The need for skilled personnel in conventional fields like medicine, nursing, pharmacy, etc. continues to outpace what our education system can provide. Very typically, we only have roughly 5 million of these professionals, or less than half of what we currently require. With such obstacles, the emphasis has also shifted to closing gaps so that care delivery is sophisticated, affordable, and accessible. A workforce that is highly skilled, effective, and always prepared is also required to meet future difficulties including an ageing population and unresolved health concerns.</p>
        
        <p>With the use of efficient online learning tools, medical personnel will need to stay up with best practices from around the world and breakthroughs in medicine, diagnostics, treatment, and patient care. For their employees' holistic development and progression, modern, dynamic healthcare firms are teaching and upgrading the following skills to them:</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">Leveraging New Technologies</h3>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">Design Thinking</h3>
        <p>For people working in the healthcare industry, several soft skills are crucial. Health technology and innovation heavily rely on human connections.

With the use of efficient online learning tools, they will need to stay up with best practices from around the world and breakthroughs in medicine, diagnostics, treatment, and patient care.</p>
        
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-gray-800">Leadership</h3>
        <p>Healthcare professionals must learn how to lead, manage teams, and present themselves. They ought to be capable of spotting and bridging any gaps between patients' expectations and the actual services offered.
